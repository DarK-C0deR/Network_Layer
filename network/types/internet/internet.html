           To enable communication, every individual network node or phase is designed with similar protocol or communication logic, that is Transfer Control Protocol (TCP) or Internet Protocol (IP).

           Once a network communicates with another network having constant communication procedures, it’s called Internetworking. Internetworking was designed to resolve the matter of delivering a packet of information through many links.
             </textarea><br><br>

           <textarea class="text2" disabled>There are chiefly 3 unit of Internetworking:

              * Extranet
              * Intranet
              * Internet

              Intranets and extranets might or might not have connections to the net. If there is a connection to the net, the computer network or extranet area unit is usually shielded from being accessed from the net if it is not authorized. The net isn’t thought-about to be a section of the computer network or extranet, though it should function a portal for access to parts of associate degree extranet.

             <textarea class="text6" disabled>Internetworking has evolved as an answer to a few key problems:
                    Isolated LANs, duplication of resources, and an absence of network management. 

                    Isolated LANs created transmission problem between totally different offices or departments. Duplication of resources meant that constant hardware and code had to be provided to every workplace or department, as did a separate support employee. This lack of network management meant that no centralized methodology of managing and troubleshooting networks existed.
